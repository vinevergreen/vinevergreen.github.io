<p>the Evergreen tree comes pre-provisioned to upload its output to a GitHub Pages site. to do this, open a <a href="using-pub.html">terminal</a>, <code>cd</code> to the root of the Evergreen project, and run the command <code>./up.sh</code>.</p>
<p>you will be prompted for a password. unless you have changed this through git's web interface (which you should when you have a chance; once you do, delete the <code>default-password</code> file), this is the password found in the <code>default-password</code> file at the root of the tree. type this password (note that the characters will not be displayed onscreen, not even as asterisks) and press <strong>Enter</strong>. when you are returned to a shell prompt, your site has been uploaded.</p>
